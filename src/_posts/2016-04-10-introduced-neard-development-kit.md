title: Introduced Neard Development Kit
tags: [neard, devkit]
---

The Development Kit has finally been developed!<br />
This requires [Java SE Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase7-521261.html) (at least the JDK 1.7.0_25) and [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) (at least Apache Ant 1.8.0).<br />
For the moment you can create and update modules.
